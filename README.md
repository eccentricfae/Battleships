edit: you ever look at your old code and think to yourself "ew, what is that? why did I write it in that way?"? Yeah, that's me looking at this repo, I'd like to rewrite it someday if I find the time, but for now let it be a time capsule reminding myself to always strive for improvement

Hi! This is a project written in C++ for one of my college classes, and we were supposed to pay heavy focus on OOP, polymorphism, templates, STL and good programming practices in general (like readability :)).

Implemented in Windows console.
The program uses a discrete InterfaceIO-derivitave-class object for all output / input operations so that one can easily rewrite this program's interface, and change very little inside the rest of the files (if anything), rather than search and rewrite hundreds of lines of code inside all of the files. 
<br><br>The logic of the game is mainly in the: main.cpp, Player.h/.cpp, AIPlayer.h/.cpp files, while the rest of the files are an auxilliary part of the program for easier implementation of the aforementioned main-game-logic files.

If you somehow ended up here and wanted to check out, comment, rewrite etc. this project and you had any question let me know :)
