# Battleships
Hi! This is a project written in C++ for one of my college classes, and we were supposed to pay heavy focus on OOP, polymorphism, templates, STL and good programming practices in general (like readability :)).

The program is built with two main parts (main.cpp and Player/AIPlayer classes) and some supplementary code for easier implementation (rest of the project).

main.cpp:
In the main.cpp file we have:

class Player:
//

class AIPlayer:
//

reest here?
