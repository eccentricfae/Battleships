WHAT I LEFT ON: 
    :) test everything?
    :) write saveing/loading stuff
    :) write instructions and rules

NOTES:
    - make sure all the .cpp files are in the configuration file;
    - typedef's Coords n Board in which file??
    - przy deklaracji nowych wskaznikow ustawiaj je na poczatku na nullptr (i nie wiem czy przy delete (something) tez nie ustawiac na nullptr potem?)
    
    - ? how to implement ships?:
        - pure virtual destructor
        - ? exception handling inside the aforementioned function? // note: IDK what i was thinking, prolly ignore this
        - pure virtual destructor in Ship class will allow for that class to be absract without forcing to make any stupid overrides in the derived classes

    - exceptions:
        - error handling with exceptions in function (method) that read user input
            - coordinates, menu, loading fom the file
        - Ship::setHleath() throws?

    - ? saving and loading:
        - the boards just direclty print to file? 

TODO:
    - Player::
        - include <iterator> or not?
    - Ships::
            - remove static counters if ships are placed statically
            - Ship::getCoordsVector() poitrzbne czy wywalic?
    - Interface:
        - check if IConsole poprawnie napisalem (czy dziala jak nalezy, szczegolnie printBoard())
        - funkcja ktora przyjmuje od uzytkownika path to file
            - throws (exception) in that function?
        -
    - ? should class documentation be this fucking long? (add detailed description to classes?? jak ma milosz)
    
    - make STATIC member function that checks if the data in the save file is in the correct format? (or maybe this should be a function of its own?)
    - in main: throw everything you can into functions so that it looks clean and can easily be modified!
    - document everything:
        - file docs for main.cpp (and possibly for all header files?)
    - doxygen comments:
        - brief and how to use in the header file
        - how it works in the cpp file
        - @throw / @exception - in the documentation for things that throw?
    - at the end:
        - write instructions
        - write rules (separate from instructions or not?)
        - check where what libraries are included and delete those that arent necessary
        - see if typedef documentation is properly generated
    - change colors in the console?

LEARN:
    - why static member data cannot be initialized inside the class but has to be in cpp file
    - std::array learn about it

NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
New
    - statically 7 ships always or maybe more or less (user choice when to stop (with some upper bound))
    - the rule of 5
    - pointers vs references in functions?
    - templates gdzies wcisnac?
    - refactoring from the guru site?

Presentation NOTES:
    - prepare something for pure virtual destructor (in class: Ship)
    - <utility> in Ship for std::pair
    - static virtual member function are not legal cuz if you call Ship::canBeCreated(), then how is computer supposed to know which ship are you trying to create?
    - make_pair can implcicitly deduce types of passed arguments;
    - I used srand/rand and not the proper engines and distributions because I only needed trivial semi-random numbers
